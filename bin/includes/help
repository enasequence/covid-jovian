Jovian, user friendly genomics - version $VERSION, built with Snakemake

Please refer to the documentation for more information: https://jovian.rivm-bioinformatics.com

$full_line

Use case 1; agnostic metagenomic analysis based on Illumina data:
      bash jovian illumina-metagenomics -i <INPUT_DIR> <parameters>

Use case 2; align Illumina data against a user-provided reference genome to generate a consensus 
            genome:
      bash jovian illumina-reference -i <INPUT_DIR> -ref <REF_FASTA> <parameters>

Use case 3; align Nanopore multiplex PCR data to a user-provided reference genome, remove 
            overrepresented primer sequences, and generate a consensus genome:
      bash jovian nanopore-reference -i <INPUT_DIR> -ref <REF_FASTA> -pr <PRIMER_FASTA> <parameters>

Workflow specification:
  illumina-metagenomics, illumina-meta, ilm-meta, im
                                    This specifies the "illumina metagenomics" workflow to be
                                      executed. This has to be the first argument given and does not 
                                      require a "-".
                                      Incompatible with other workflow-specification arguments.

  illumina-reference, illumina-ref, ilm-ref, ir
                                    This specifies the "Illumina Reference Alignment" workflow
                                      to be executed. This has to be the first argument given and 
                                      does not require a "-".
                                      Incompatible with other workflow-specification arguments.

  nanopore-reference, nanopore-ref, nano-ref, ont-ref, nr
                                    This specifies the "Nanopore Reference Alignment" workflow
                                      to be executed. This has to be the first argument given and 
                                      does not require a "-".
                                      Incompatible with other workflow-specification arguments.

Input:
  -i, --input [DIR]                 This is the folder containing your input fastq files.
                                      Default is 'raw_data/' and only relative paths are accepted.
  -ref, --reference [FASTA FILE]    This is the FASTA used as a reference sequence for the 
                                      reference-based workflows. Only a single reference is supported.
                                      Only works with the "Illumina-reference" or "Nanopore-reference"
                                      workflows.
  -pr, --primers [FASTA FILE]       This is the FASTA containing the primer sequences used to produce
                                      the sequenced amplicons. Only works with the "Nanopore-reference"
                                      workflow.

Output (automatically generated):
  data/                             Contains detailed intermediate files.
  logs/                             Contains all log files.
  results/                          Contains all final results and audit-trail.
                                      Results are visualized via the Jovian report.

Virus typing:
  -vt-help, --virus-typing-help     Print additional information about the virus-typing, i.e. which 
                                      family/genus is selected and which species are typed.
  -vt, --virus-typing [all|NoV|EV|RVA|HAV|HEV|PV|Flavi]
                                    After a Jovian analyses has completed, do viral typing for
                                      Norovirus (NoV), Enterovirus (EV), Hepatitis A (HAV), 
                                      Hepatitis E (HEV), Rotavirus A (RVA), Papillomaviruses (PV),
                                      Flaviviruses (Flavi). Or use the 'all' keyword to perform
                                      virus typing for all above listed viruses.
                                      For additional explanation, --vt-help
  -vt-force, --virus-typing-force [NoV|EV|RVA|HAV|HEV|PV|Flavi]
                                    Same as above, but overwrites existing output.

Parameters:
  -m, --mode [strict|relaxed]       Automatically configures Jovian to be stringent or relaxed
                                      in taxonomic classification of scaffolds. Please see the 
                                      publication for details. In short, use 'strict' for high 
                                      precision at the cost of sensitivity and use 'relaxed' for
                                      high sensitivity at the cost of more spurious results
                                      (contamination). Default: relaxed.
  -cq, --cluster-queue [Queue name] One-time override of the default cluster-queue settings.
                                      Use this command when you wish to use a different computing-
                                      queue without manually going through the jovian settings.
                                      This does not change your default settings.
  -h, --help                        Print the Jovian help document.
  -sh, --snakemake-help             Print the Snakemake help document.
  --clean (-y)                      Removes all Jovian output, both the metagenomics output and
                                      reference alignment output. (-y forces "Yes" on all prompts)
  -k, --keep-going                  Useful snakemake command: Go on with independent jobs if
                                      a job fails.
  -n, --dry-run                     Useful snakemake command: Do not execute anything, and
                                      display what would be done.
  -u, --unlock                      Removes the lock on the working directory. This happens when
                                      a run ends abruptly and prevents you from doing subsequent
                                      analyses.
  -q, --quiet                       Useful snakemake command: Do not output any progress or
                                      rule information.

Archiving Jovian results:
  --archive (-y)                    Archives the output of a Jovian analysis into single
                                      compressed file. (-y forces "Yes" on all prompts)
  --rebuild-archive                 Rebuilds Jovian results and logs from a previously made 
                                      archive. It is important to use the same version of Jovian
                                      as was initially used to build the archive. N.B. databases
                                      are not restored.

Jupyter Notebook (for data visualization):
  --configure-jupyter               Sets the proper Jupyter settings. You only need to do this
                                      once per user.
  --start-jupyter                   Starts a Jupyter Notebook process. You must always have this
                                      running in a separate terminal (or in the background) if you
                                      want to open the final report with the interactive graphs
                                      and tables.

Installation:
  -ic, --install-dependencies       Install the required software dependencies for the
                                      metagenomics and reference alignment workflows.
  -id, --install-databases          Install required databases.

Debug only:
  --start-nginx                     Starts the nginx process.
  --stop-nginx                      Stops the nginx process.
  --make-sample-sheet               Only make the sample sheet.

Other:
  -v, --version                     Print the current version of Jovian.
  --update                          Updates Jovian to the latest release. Some files might be
                                      reset to their default contents as shown on Github.
  --update [Version tag]            Changes Jovian to the specified release. Only accepts major
                                      releases. Files can get deleted in significant version changes.
  --reset-db                        Forgets the locations where the databases were installed.
                                      Requires db-locations to be set again the next time Jovian runs.
