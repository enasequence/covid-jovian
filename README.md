## About Jovian  

Jovian is a Public Health toolkit to automatically process raw NGS data from human clinical matrices (faeces, serum, etc.) into clinically relevant information. It has three main components:  

- **Illumina based Metagenomics**:  
  Includes (amongst other features) data quality control, assembly, taxonomic classification, viral typing, and minority variant identification (quasispecies).  
  :memo: Please refer to the [documentation page for the Illumina Metagenomics workflow][ILM_meta_wf] for more information.  

- **Illumina based Reference-alignment**:  
  Includes (amongst other features) data quality control, alignment, SNP identification, and consensus-sequence generation.  
  :exclamation: A reference fasta is required.  
  :memo: Please refer to the [documentation page for the Illumina Reference based workflow][ILM_ref_wf] for more information.  

- **Nanopore based Reference-alignment**:  
  Includes (amongst other features) data quality control, alignment, SNP identification, and consensus-sequence generation.  
  :exclamation: A reference fasta is required.  
  :exclamation: A fasta with primer sequences is required.  
  :memo: Please refer to the [documentation page for the Nanopore Reference based workflow][ONT_ref_wf] for more information.  

### Key features of Jovian:  

- **User-friendliness**:  
  Wetlab personnel can start, configure and interpret results via an interactive web-report. [Click here for an example report][example_report].  
  This makes doing Public Health analyses much more accessible and user-friendly since minimal command-line skills are required.


- **Audit trail**:  
  All pipeline parameters, software versions, database information and runtime statistics are logged. See details [below](#audit-trail).  

- **Portable**:  
  Jovian is easily installed on off-site computer systems and at back-up sister institutes. Allowing results to be generated even when the internal grid-computer is down (speaking from experience).

## Commands  

:memo: Please see the full [Command Line Reference on the documentation site][CLI_ref] for a more detailed explanation of each command, including [example commands for starting an analysis][CLI_examples_analysis] or [common usage examples][CLI_examples_cmd].

Here, we have a short list of commands and use cases that are used very frequently.

**Use case 1:**   
Metagenomic analylsis based on Illumina data:  
```
bash jovian illumina-metagenomics -i <INPUT DIRECTORY>
```

**Use case 2:**  
Align Illumina data against a user-provided reference to generate a consensus genome:  
```
bash jovian illumina-reference -i <INPUT DIRECTORY> -ref <REFERENCE FASTA>
```

**Use case 3:**  
Align Nanopore (multiplex) PCR data against a user-provided reference, remove overrepresented primer sequences, and generate a consensus genome:
```
bash jovian nanopore-reference -i <INPUT DIRECTORY> -ref <REFERENCE FASTA> -pr <PRIMER FASTA>
```
use `bash jovian -h` to see a full list of commands applicable to the Jovian version that you're using.

## Features

:memo: Please refer to our [documentation for the full list of features][featurelist]

### General features

- Data quality control and cleaning.  
  - Including library fragment length analysis, useful for sample preparation QC.  
- Removal of human* data (patient privacy). _*<sup><sub>You can use [whichever reference you would like][faq]. However, Jovian is intended for human clinical samples.</sup></sub>_  
- Removal of PCR-duplicates for Illumina data.  

### Metagenomics specific features

- Assembly of short reads into bigger scaffolds (often full viral genomes).  
- Taxonomic classification:  
  - Every nucleic acid containing biological entity (i.e. not only viruses) is determined up to species level.  
  - Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) analysis is performed to move ambiguous results up to their last common ancestor, which makes results more robust.  
- Viral typing:
  - Several viral families and genera can be taxonomically labelled at the sub-species level as described [here](#virus-typing).  
- Viral scaffolds are cross-referenced against the Virus-Host interaction database and NCBI host database.  
- Scaffolds are annotated in detail:  
  - Depth of coverage.  
  - GC content.  
  - Open reading frames (ORFs) are predicted.  
  - Minority variants (quasispecies) are identified.  
- Importantly, results of all processes listed above are presented via an [interactive web-report][example_report] including an [audit trail](#audit-trail).  

### Reference-alignment specific features

- All cleaned reads are aligned against the user-provided reference fasta.  
- In the case of Nanopore (multiplex) PCR data, the overrepresented primer sequences are removed.  
- SNPs are called and a consensus genome is generated.  
- Consensus genomes are filtered at the following coverage cut-off thresholds: 1, 5, 10, 30 and 100x.  
- A tabular overview of the breadth of coverage (BoC) at the different coverage cut-off thresholds is generated.  
- Alignments and visualized via `IGVjs` and allow manual assessment and validation of consensus genomes.  

### Visualizations

All data are visualized via an interactive web-report, [as shown here][example_report], which includes:  

- A collation of interactive QC graphs via `MultiQC`.  
- Taxonomic results are presented on three levels:  
  - For an entire (multi sample) run, interactive heatmaps are made for non-phage viruses, phages and bacteria. They are stratified to different taxonomic levels.  
  - For a sample level overview, `Krona` interactive taxonomic piecharts are generated.  
  - For more detailed analyses, interactive tables are included. Similar to popular spreadsheet applications (e.g. Microsoft Excel).  
    - Classified scaffolds  
    - Unclassified scaffolds (i.e. "Dark Matter")  
- Virus typing results are presented via interactive spreadsheet-like tables.  
- An interactive scaffold alignment viewer (`IGVjs`) is included, containing:  
  - Detailed alignment information.  
  - Depth of coverage graph.  
  - GC content graph.
  - Predicted open reading frames (ORFs).  
  - Identified minority variants (quasispecies).  
- All SNP metrics are presented via interactive spreadsheet-like tables, allowing detailed analysis.  

### Virus typing

After a Jovian analysis is finished you can perform virus-typing (i.e. sub-species level taxonomic labelling). These analyses can be started by the command `bash jovian -vt [virus keyword]`, where `[virus keyword]` can be:  

Keyword | Taxon used for scaffold selection | Notable virus species
--------|-----------------------------------|----------------------
`NoV` | Caliciviridae   | Norovirus GI and GII, Sapovirus  
`EV`  | Picornaviridae  | Enteroviruses (Coxsackie, Polio, Rhino, etc.), Parecho, Aichi, Hepatitis A 
`RVA` | _Rotavirus A_   | Rotavirus A  
`HAV` | _Hepatovirus A_ | Hepatitis A  
`HEV` | _Orthohepevirus A_ | Hepatitis E  
`PV`  | Papillomaviridae | Human Papillomavirus  
`Flavi` | Flaviviridae    | Dengue (work in progress)
`all` | All of the above | All of the above
  
### Audit trail

An audit trail, used for clinical reproducibility and logging, is generated and contains:  

- A unique methodological fingerprint: allowing to exactly reproduce the analysis, even retrospectively by reverting to old versions of the pipeline code.  
- The following information is also logged:  
  - Database timestamps  
  - (user-specified) Pipeline parameters  

However, it has limitations since several things are out-of-scope for Jovian to control:

- The `virus typing-tools` version  
  - Currently we depend on a public web-tool hosted by the [RIVM][RIVM]. These are developed in close collaboration with - *but independently of* - Jovian. A versioning system for the `virus typing-tools` is being worked on, however, this is not trivial and will take some time.  
- Input files and metadata
  - We only save the names and location of input files at the time the analysis was performed. Long-term storage of the data, and documenting their location over time, is the responsibility of the end-user. Likewise, the end-user is responsible for storing datasets with their correct metadata (e.g. clinical information, database versions, etc.). We recommend using [iRODS][irods] for this as described by [Nieroda et al. 2019][irods_ref]. While we acknowledge that database versions are vital to replicate results, the databases Jovian uses have no official versioning, hence why we include timestamps only.
